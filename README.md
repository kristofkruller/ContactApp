# ContactApp
Full stack contact list page 


1. Build a contact list page in HTML5 and CSS3

You can see a Figma file on the link below. Build the web page with the add, remove and edit flows in the file. Pay attention to the design details. Use a Javascript framework (Vue, React or Angular) and make sure to create and use reusable components for different page elements.

2. Make it responsive

Make sure the page will work well on mobile.


3. Build the backend

Build the backend of this Contact app. Make sure you serve the contact data from a database, and also make the add, remove and edit flows work. You can use any database you like, but using SQLite with the database file included in your repository would be preferable as it allows us to review your project in its entirety.


4. Please share a repo link uploaded to github.
Please link your solution below. Make sure to include a readme file that tells us how to run your solution on localhost.
